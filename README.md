# Network Security Pipeline

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a modular, scalable, and automated network security monitoring pipeline that facilitates the ingestion, validation, preprocessing, and initial analysis of network traffic data. The system is designed to detect potential anomalies and suspicious activities in network traffic, enhancing the security posture by enabling proactive monitoring and response.

This project focuses on creating a reliable foundation for network security data workflows by integrating data engineering, validation schemas, containerized deployment, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

## What I Have Done

- **Data Ingestion & Processing:** Developed scripts to efficiently collect and ingest network traffic logs from various sources into a structured format, ensuring comprehensive data coverage.
- **Data Validation:** Designed and implemented a schema-based validation system to verify the correctness and integrity of network traffic data, catching inconsistencies early in the pipeline.
- **Anomaly Detection Module:** Created initial algorithms to identify anomalous patterns in the traffic data that might indicate security threats or abnormal behavior.
- **Web Interface:** Built a lightweight Flask-based web application to visualize network traffic statistics and anomalies via an interactive dashboard for easier monitoring.
- **Containerization:** Packaged all components using Docker to ensure consistent running environments, ease of deployment, and scalability across different platforms.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Configured GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, validation, and deployment of updates, reducing manual effort and increasing reliability.
- **Extensibility:** Structured the codebase and components to enable seamless future enhancements such as advanced machine learning models for anomaly detection or integration with real-time alert systems.

## Key Features

- Automated and modular pipeline design for network security data workflows.
- Robust validation of incoming data against predefined schemas.
- Initial anomaly detection capabilities with scope for machine learning integration.
- Interactive web dashboard for visual analytics and monitoring.
- Fully containerized environment using Docker for deployment consistency.
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions for streamlined development cycles.

## Technologies Used

- Python (data processing, validation, backend services)
- Flask (web dashboard and API)
- Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
- Docker (containerization)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)
- Additional supporting libraries for PDF parsing, network log analysis, and frontend (if applicable)

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AryanKhurana17/Network_Security.git
    cd Network_Security
    ```

2. **Install required packages:**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run locally:**

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

    This launches the Flask server accessible at `http://localhost:5000`, presenting the network security dashboard.

4. **Using Docker:**

    Build the Docker image:

    ```
    docker build -t network_security_app .
    ```

    Run a container:

    ```
    docker run -p 5000:5000 network_security_app
    ```

5. **CI/CD Pipeline:**

    The project includes GitHub Actions workflows that automate the testing and deployment processes. Upon push or PR, these workflows ensure code quality and deploy updates automatically.

## Repository Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application.
- `networksecurity/`: Core modules for validation, data processing, and anomaly detection.
- `Network_data/`: Sample and input network traffic datasets.
- `templates/`: HTML files for the dashboard.
- `.github/workflows/`: GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline.
- `dockerfile`: Docker configuration file for container image building.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Future Work and Expansion Ideas

- Integrating advanced machine learning models for improved anomaly detection.
- Adding real-time streaming data processing using technologies like Kafka.
- Enhancing the dashboard with detailed analytics and alerting mechanisms.
- Integrating external threat intelligence feeds.
- Expanding support to multiple network protocols and log formats.
